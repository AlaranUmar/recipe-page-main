## My process

  ### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
    - Mobile-first workflow
    - [Boostrap](https://boostrap.org/) - JS library


  ### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to implement responsive layouts using Bootstrap's grid system. It made creating a mobile-first design much easier.

```html
<body class="p-md-5">
</body>
```


  ### Continued development

While working on this project, I started learning Bootstrap, and I’ve realized how powerful it is for building responsive, mobile-first websites quickly. However, I’m not fully comfortable with all its components yet, and there’s still much for me to explore.


  ### Useful resources

<body class="p-md-5"> – This Bootstrap utility class was particularly useful in adding padding only on medium and larger screens. It allowed me to create a layout that looks cleaner on bigger devices without affecting smaller screens. I'll definitely use this technique in future projects for responsive spacing.
